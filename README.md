# üìß Email Verifier (Flask & Streamlit)

A professional-grade application for verifying email addresses using SMTP, with both single and bulk verification modes. Supports a web interface (Flask) and a modern, interactive UI (Streamlit). Upload CSV/Excel files for bulk checks, download results, and get instant feedback on email validity, deliverability, and SMTP handshake details.

## üöÄ Features

- **Single Email Verification:**
  - Instantly check if an email address is valid using SMTP handshake.
  - See EHLO/HELO handshake results, deliverability, and error logs.
  - See LinkedIn profile and job title (if available).

- **Bulk Email Verification:**
  - Upload CSV or Excel files with a list of emails.
  - Get a downloadable Excel file with verification results, including score, EHLO/HELO, deliverability, and error details.
  - Cleans up uploaded files automatically for security.

- **Modern UI:**
  - Flask web app for classic web experience.
  - Streamlit app for a fast, interactive dashboard with detailed logs.

- **Robust Verification:**
  - Checks MX records and uses SMTP commands for real-time validation.
  - Handles catch-all, greylisting, and common SMTP edge cases.
  - Retries and delays for rate-limiting errors (e.g., 421), with error reporting.
  - Returns a score and logs for each verification attempt.

## ‚ö° How the App Verifies Emails (Industry Standard)

1. **Syntax Check:**
   - Uses regex to filter out obviously invalid email formats before any network requests.

2. **MX Record Lookup:**
   - Checks if the domain has valid mail exchange (MX) records using DNS.

3. **SMTP Handshake:**
   - Connects to the mail server and performs both `EHLO` and `HELO` commands, logging their success.
   - Attempts to verify the recipient using `VRFY` (if supported) and `RCPT TO` commands.
   - Scores each email (+1 for EHLO, +1 for HELO, +1 for deliverability).
   - Handles and retries on temporary errors (e.g., 421 rate limits) with exponential backoff.

4. **Detailed Logging:**
   - Returns a dictionary for each email with score, EHLO/HELO status, deliverability, and error details.
   - All results and logs are shown in the UI and included in downloadable files.

## üéØ Accuracy & Limitations

- **Overall Accuracy:**
  - For standard business and ISP domains, SMTP verification is accurate in **80‚Äì95%** of cases.
  - For invalid/non-existent addresses, accuracy is often **90‚Äì99%**.
  - For catch-all or privacy-protected domains (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Microsoft), accuracy may be lower due to always-accept or ambiguous responses.

- **Why Not 100%?**
  - Many mail servers use catch-all addresses, greylisting, tarpitting, or privacy features that prevent reliable verification.
  - Too many rapid requests can trigger rate-limiting or blocking (handled by retry/delay logic in this app).
  - No SMTP-based verifier can guarantee 100% accuracy due to these industry-wide limitations.

- **How This App Meets Industry Standards:**
  - Uses the same SMTP handshake and MX lookup techniques as leading commercial verifiers.
  - Implements retries, delays, and error handling for robust, real-world use.
  - Provides detailed logs and scoring for transparency and troubleshooting.
  - Does not send actual emails‚Äîonly checks server responses, as per best practices.
