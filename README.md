# üìß Email Verifier (Flask)

A professional-grade, authenticated web application for verifying email addresses using SMTP, with both single and bulk verification modes. Features Google Sign-In via Firebase Authentication, per-user usage tracking and limits via Firestore, and a modern, dynamic frontend user experience. Upload CSV/Excel files for bulk checks, download results, and get instant feedback on email validity, deliverability, and SMTP handshake details.

## üöÄ Features

- **Google Sign-In (Firebase Authentication):**
  - Secure login with Google accounts (required for bulk verification).
  - User authentication handled via Firebase JS SDK (frontend) and Firebase Admin SDK (backend).

- **Per-User Usage Tracking (Firestore):**
  - Each user's bulk verification usage is tracked in Firestore by their Firebase UID.
  - Enforces a 200-row total limit per user for bulk verification.
  - Usage counter is displayed and updated dynamically in the UI.

- **Single Email Verification:**
  - Instantly check if an email address is valid using SMTP handshake.
  - See EHLO/HELO handshake results, deliverability, and error logs.
  - See LinkedIn profile and job title (if available).

- **Bulk Email Verification:**
  - Upload CSV or Excel files with a list of emails (up to 200 total per user).
  - Get a downloadable Excel file with verification results, including score, EHLO/HELO, deliverability, and error details.
  - Cleans up uploaded files automatically for security.

- **Modern UI & UX:**
  - Centered sign-in box for unauthenticated users.
  - Loading spinner during bulk verification processing.
  - Dynamic results display and download link after bulk verify (no page reload).
  - Usage counter updates after login and after uploads.
  - Disabled "Bulk Verify (Coming Soon)" button on single verify page for clarity.

- **Robust Verification:**
  - Checks MX records and uses SMTP commands for real-time validation.
  - Handles catch-all, greylisting, and common SMTP edge cases.
  - Retries and delays for rate-limiting errors (e.g., 421), with error reporting.
  - Returns a score and logs for each verification attempt.

## üîí Security & Deployment

- **Production Deployment:**
  - Use a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn or uWSGI) behind Nginx or similar.
  - Set secure permissions on `firebase_key.json` and `.env`.
  - Restrict allowed origins for Firebase Auth in the Firebase Console.
  - Use HTTPS in production.
  - For AWS, use Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EC2 with proper environment variable management.

- **Firestore & Firebase:**
  - Ensure Firestore security rules restrict access to authenticated users only.
  - Never expose your service account key (`firebase_key.json`) to the frontend or public repos.
