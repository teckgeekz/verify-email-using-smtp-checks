### Template Directories

- **templates/**: Original HTML templates, styled with classic CSS/Bootstrap-like classes. Use these for a traditional look or legacy support.
- **templates-tail/**: Modern HTML templates using Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, responsive, and visually appealing UI. Recommended for new deployments and modern browsers.

You can switch between template sets by updating the `render_template` calls in `app.py` to use the desired directory.

## üîí Security & Deployment

- **Production Deployment:**
  - Use a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn or uWSGI) behind Nginx or similar.
  - Set secure permissions on `firebase_key.json` and `.env`.
  - Restrict allowed origins for Firebase Auth in the Firebase Console.
  - Use HTTPS in production.
  - For AWS, use Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EC2 with proper environment variable management.

- **Firestore & Firebase:**
  - Ensure Firestore security rules restrict access to authenticated users only.
  - Never expose your service account key (`firebase_key.json`) to the frontend or public repos.
